I was not able to reproduce this issue in Edge 38, 42, or 44.\nI'm reticent to turn off the sticky functionality for all Edge users because of one version (or perhaps an\ninteraction of that version with a specific graphics adapter or other setting). So instead, I'm leaving this\nas an example for anyone forced to support Edge 41 who may see the same issue. If that's the case, just\nadd this selector to your own CSS.\n\n@supports (-ms-ime-align: auto) {\n\t.cv-day {\n\t\tposition: relative;\n\t}\n}\n*/\n\n_:-ms-lang(x),\n.cv-day {\n\tposition: relative;\n}\n*/ .cv-day-number {\n\tposition: absolute;\n\tright: 0;\n}\n\n.cv-event {\n\tposition: absolute;\n\twhite-space: nowrap;\n\toverflow: hidden;\n\tbackground-color: #f7f7f7;\n\tborder-width: 1px;\n\t/* Restore user's direction setting (overridden for week) */\n\tdirection: initial;\n}\n\n/* Wrap to show entire item title on hover */\n.cv-wrapper.wrap-event-title-on-hover .cv-event:hover {\n\twhite-space: normal;\n\tz-index: 1;\n}\n\n/* Colors */\n\n.cv-header-days,\n.cv-header-day,\n.cv-weeks,\n.cv-week,\n.cv-day,\n.cv-event {\n\tborder-style: solid;\n\tborder-color: #ddd;\n}\n\n/* Item Times */\n.cv-event .endTime::before {\n\tcontent: \"-\";\n}\n\n/* Internal Metrics */\n.cv-header-day,\n.cv-day-number,\n.cv-event {\n\tpadding: 0.2em;\n}\n\n/* Allows emoji icons or labels (such as holidays) to be added more easily to specific dates by having the margin set already. */\n.cv-day-number::before {\n\tmargin-right: 0.5em;\n}\n\n.cv-event.offset0 {\n\tleft: 0;\n}\n\n.cv-event.offset1 {\n\tleft: calc((100% / 7));\n}\n\n.cv-event.offset2 {\n\tleft: calc((200% / 7));\n}\n\n.cv-event.offset3 {\n\tleft: calc((300% / 7));\n}\n\n.cv-event.offset4 {\n\tleft: calc((400% / 7));\n}\n\n.cv-event.offset5 {\n\tleft: calc((500% / 7));\n}\n\n.cv-event.offset6 {\n\tleft: calc((600% / 7));\n}\n\n/* Metrics for items spanning dates */\n\n.cv-event.span1 {\n\twidth: calc((100% / 7) - 0.05em);\n}\n\n.cv-event.span2 {\n\twidth: calc((200% / 7) - 0.05em);\n}\n\n.cv-event.span3 {\n\twidth: calc((300% / 7) - 0.05em);\n\ttext-align: center;\n}\n\n.cv-event.span4 {\n\twidth: calc((400% / 7) - 0.05em);\n\ttext-align: center;\n}\n\n.cv-event.span5 {\n\twidth: calc((500% / 7) - 0.05em);\n\ttext-align: center;\n}\n\n.cv-event.span6 {\n\twidth: calc((600% / 7) - 0.05em);\n\ttext-align: center;\n}\n\n.cv-event.span7 {\n\twidth: calc((700% / 7) - 0.05em);\n\ttext-align: center;\n}\n\n/* Hide scrollbars for the grid and the week */\n.cv-weeks::-webkit-scrollbar,\n.cv-week::-webkit-scrollbar {\n\twidth: 0; /* remove scrollbar space */\n\tbackground: transparent; /* optional: just make scrollbar invisible */\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./CalendarView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./CalendarView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","/* globals __VUE_SSR_CONTEXT__ */\n\n// IMPORTANT: Do NOT use ES2015 features in this file (except for modules).\n// This module is a runtime utility for cleaner component module output and will\n// be included in the final webpack user bundle.\n\nexport default function normalizeComponent (\n  scriptExports,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  functionalTemplate,\n  injectStyles,\n  scopeId,\n  moduleIdentifier, /* server only */\n  shadowMode /* vue-cli only */\n) {\n  // Vue.extend constructor export interop\n  var options = typeof scriptExports === 'function'\n    ?
